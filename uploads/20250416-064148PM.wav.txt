John G. Paton, as detailed in his autobiography *John G. Paton, Missionary to the New Hebrides, Volume 2 (of 3)*, was a missionary to the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu).  The book's second volume covers his travels to Australia to raise funds and support for the mission, and his subsequent work establishing a mission on Aniwa Island.

His activities included:

* **Raising funds and support in Australia:**  After being rescued from Tanna, he traveled extensively throughout Australia, preaching in churches and to diverse groups (including Aborigines and gold miners) to garner support for a much-needed mission ship ("Dayspring") and additional missionaries. This involved considerable hardship, including getting lost in the bush, sinking in a swamp, and even spending three days in a public house due to unforeseen circumstances.  His methods were unconventional, reflecting his strong faith and determination.

* **Mission work amongst Australian Aborigines:** The book details his interactions with the Aboriginal people, observing their culture and religious practices, witnessing their suffering at the hands of colonization, and attempting to share the Gospel.

* **Establishing a mission on Aniwa:**  He details the challenges and triumphs of establishing a mission on Aniwa, including building homes, schools, and a church, facing opposition from the local population's heathen beliefs and practices (including sorcery and infanticide), and witnessing conversions and the gradual adoption of Christianity.  The book includes numerous anecdotes and accounts of the lives of Aniwan people, their gradual acceptance of the gospel, and their unique cultural expression within a Christian context.

* **Returning to Britain to raise more funds:**  The book also describes a later trip to Britain to raise funds for the mission, navigating the complexities of different Presbyterian denominations and encountering various individuals who contributed significantly to the mission's success.  

Throughout, the book emphasizes Paton's deep faith, perseverance in the face of adversity, and commitment to spreading Christianity in challenging circumstances.  It presents a detailed account of his travels, missionary efforts, and personal experiences, portraying him as a dedicated and resourceful individual.
